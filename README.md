###Meteorite landings on earth

A D3.js created chart mapping meteorite landings on earth.

Each meteorite is represented by a circle. The size of circle corresponds to the mass of the meteorite.

To see additional information about a meteorite, hover over it and a tooltip will pop up with more information. Also, the user can zoom in and out and drag the map around to deeply explore an area.

Enjoy!
